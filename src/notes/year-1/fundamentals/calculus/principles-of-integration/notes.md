## Introduction

The foundational princeiple behind itegration is to find the area under a curve. For common solid shapes we have equations for calculating their area, but arbitary graphs are not that simple.

## Integration generalised

In general, we can say the integral of each element of a polynomail is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= x^n \\\\
\displaystyle\int f(x) &= \dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $c$ is a constant.

## Trigonometric functions

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= sin(ax) \\\\
\\\\
\displaystyle\int f(x) &= - \dfrac{cos(ax)}{a} + c
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= cos(ax) \\\\
\\\\
\displaystyle\int f(x) &= \dfrac{sin(ax)}{a} + c
\end{aligned}
$$
