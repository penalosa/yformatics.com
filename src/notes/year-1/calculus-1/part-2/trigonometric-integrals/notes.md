## Identities

In order to do complex trigonometric problems, you may often need to substitute out the function you are given for another. When done correctly this can vastly simplify calculations.

Some common identities that can be useful are given below:

$$tan \\, \theta = \dfrac{sin \\, \theta}{cos \\, \theta}$$

$${sec \\, \theta = \dfrac{1}{cos \\, \theta}} \qquad \qquad {cot \\, \theta = \dfrac{1}{tan \\, \theta}}$$

## Pythagoras

Throughout this course, you may come across questions that not only require you to apply your knowledge of everything in the textbook and lecture content but also use previous maths knowledge. One very common example of this is using right-angled triangles.

Recall that the formula for calculating the length of sides is:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
