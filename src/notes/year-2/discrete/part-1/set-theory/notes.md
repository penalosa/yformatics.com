## Introduction

A set is a collection of elements. It can be finite or infinite and the order of the elements does not matter. Repeated elements in the set are only listed once. A set can also be empty.

The 'cardinality' of a set is defined as the number of elements in that set. It has the notation $|A|$. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

## Ordered pairs

An ordered pair is a set $(a,b)$ that contains two elements where the order they are in does matter. An example of this you might have seen before is 2-dimentional coordinates.

<!-- $$\\{\\{a\\},\\{a,b\\}\\}$$ -->

## Cartesian product

This is sometimes also called the 'cross product' of two sets. It is a set of ordered pairs.

$$A \times B = \\{(a,b) | a \in A \land b \in B\\}$$

The order that the sets are crossed in matters as the first element of each ordered pair comes from the first set and the second from the second set.

## Subsets

A subset is a set of elements, $B$, whose elements are also elements of a larger set, $A$. It has the notation $B \subset A$. The empty set is also a subset of every set.

<!-- Should the counting subsets section of the next topic be here? -->

## Power sets

A power set is a set of elements, $P(A)$, which contains every possible subset of another set, $A$. Since the empty set is a subset of every set, it is also in the power set.

The cardinality of a power set, $|P(A)|$, is given by $2^{|A|}$.
