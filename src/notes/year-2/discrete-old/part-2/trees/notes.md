## Introduction

A tree is a connected simple undirected graph with no simple circuits. A forest is a (not necessarily connected) simple connected graph with no simple circuits.

A graph $G$ is a tree iff there is a unique simple path between any two vertices of $G$.

Every tree $T = (V,E)$ with $|V| \ge 2$ has at least two vertices that have degree 1.

Every tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges.

## Rooted trees

A rooted tree is a pair $(T,r)$ where $T = (V,E)$ is a tree and $r \in V$ is a chosen root of that tree.

## Terminology

## m-ary trees

## Rooted ordered trees

## Counting vertices

## Based sorting

## Spanning trees
