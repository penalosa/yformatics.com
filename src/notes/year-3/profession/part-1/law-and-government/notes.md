## Jurisdiction

The word jurisdiction is used to mean the area covered by a single legal system and set of laws. In this course, our definition of a 'law' shall be taken as a set of rules that can be enforced in a court in a given jurisdiction.

Different countries have different legal systems but these can also differ within countries, right down to local counties. The larger the country, the more localisation the legal system tends to have. The most obvious examples of this are India and the US which a central federal government and many states each with their own governing body.

## Criminal law

The version of the law you hear most about in popular culture is where someone commits a crime and is punished with a fine or prison time. This is referred to as criminal law where the government of each jurisdiction sets a standard for acceptable behaviour and takes responsibility to charge offenders.

## Civil law

The purpose of civil law is to provide rules for settling disputes between people. In this case, 'people' refers to the legal definition of a person, either a 'natural person' meaning a human or an organisation that has gone through the process of 'incorporation'.

This side of the law will be the focus of this part of the course. There are several different ways in which an organisation can be incorporated. In Britain, an organisation can be incorporated by an Act of Parliament, by registering as a company or by the grant of a royal charter. We shall discuss this process in later topics.

## Litigation

Court action under civil law is known as litigation. It must be initiated by the legal person who feels wronged, known as the 'claimant' or 'plaintiff'. Together with the defendant, they are referred to as the 'parties of dispute'.

The main features of litigation under civil law are standard and burden of proof. Under criminal law, it falls on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond all reasonable doubt. In civil court, a claimant only has to show that their claim is correct on the balance of probabilities. Both parties must present arguments to convince the court in their favour with no assumptions taken upfront.

## Sources of law

In England and Wales, there are two main sources called 'common law' and 'statute law' that can be referenced in court.

Common law refers to tradition and precedent that is not written down in law but depends on the previous judgements made in court over the centuries. It is also shared across many countries, meaning a judgement in one jurisdiction could be used as a precedent argument in another if they both follow the same convention. However, not all countries use the tradition of common law; most countries in the Commonwealth do whereas many in mainland Europe reply only on written laws.

Statute law refers to the rules laid down by Acts of Parliament called legislation. If you rewind back a few hundred years, most civil disputes would have been settled under common law. As times have changed and society has moved on, legislation has become necessary to tackle rising challenges such as computer misuse and intellectual property. In some areas where it has become messy between common and statute law, the government has legislated to bring it all under one new statute. An example of this would be the Theft Act 1968, which consolidated the common law provisions regarding crimes involving stealing.

## The legislative process

Like many other democratic countries, the UK has what is known as a two-chamber or bicameral legislature known as Parliament.

The first chamber is called the House of Commons which has 659 elected members.
