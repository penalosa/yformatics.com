## Jurisdiction

The word jurisdiction is used to mean the area covered by a single legal system and set of laws. In this course, our definition of a 'law' shall be taken as a set of rules that can be enforced in a court in a given jurisdiction.

Different countries have different legal systems but these can also differ within countries, right down to local counties. The larger the country, the more localisation the legal system tends to have. The most obvious examples of this are India and the US which a central federal government and many states each with their own governing body.

## Criminal law

The version of the law you hear most about in popular culture is where someone commits a crime and is punished with a fine or prison time. This is referred to as criminal law where the government of each jurisdiction sets a standard for acceptable behaviour and takes responsibility to charge offenders.

## Civil law

The purpose of civil law is to provide rules for settling disputes between people. In this case, 'people' refers to the legal definition of a person, either a 'natural person' meaning a human or an organisation that has gone through the process of 'incorporation'.

This side of the law will be the focus of this part of the course. There are several different ways in which an organisation can be incorporated. In Britain, an organisation can be incorporated by an Act of Parliament, by registering as a company or by the grant of a royal charter. We shall discuss this process in later topics.

## Litigation

Court action under civil law is known as litigation. It must be initiated by the legal person who feels wronged, known as the 'claimant' or 'plaintiff'. Together with the defendant, they are referred to as the 'parties of dispute'.

The main features of litigation under civil law are standard and burden of proof. Under criminal law, it falls on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond all reasonable doubt. In civil court, a claimant only has to show that their claim is correct on the balance of probabilities. Both parties must present arguments to convince the court in their favour with no assumptions taken upfront.

## Sources of law

In England and Wales, there are two main sources called 'common law' and 'statute law' that can be referenced in court.

Common law refers to tradition and precedent that is not written down in law but depends on the previous judgements made in court over the centuries. It is also shared across many countries, meaning a judgement in one jurisdiction could be used as a precedent argument in another if they both follow the same convention. However, not all countries use the tradition of common law; most countries in the Commonwealth do whereas many in mainland Europe reply only on written laws.

Statute law refers to the rules laid down by Acts of Parliament called legislation. If you rewind back a few hundred years, most civil disputes would have been settled under common law. As times have changed and society has moved on, legislation has become necessary to tackle rising challenges such as computer misuse and intellectual property. In some areas where it has become messy between common and statute law, the government has legislated to bring it all under one new statute. An example of this would be the Theft Act 1968, which consolidated the common law provisions regarding crimes involving stealing.

## The legislative process

Like many other democratic countries, the UK has what is known as a two-chamber or bicameral legislature known as Parliament.

The first chamber is called the House of Commons which has 659 elected members. The second chamber is called the House of Lords which has 300 members that are appointed with some inheriting their position.

> The British government is made up of members from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Members of the House of Lords are never more than a small proportion and the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary are now always members of the House of Commons.

New pieces of legislation are often introduced by the government but can come from any member of parliament. This is done in what is called a 'bill' that is then discussed, amended and approved. Bills pass through the House of Commons before progressing to the House of Lords, although there are many smaller steps involved in this. Once a bill has passed parliamentary approval it is then taken to the Queen to receive royal assent to become law.

> If the House of Lords rejects a bill or modifies it, the bill is returned to the House of Commons for further consideration. The House of Commons has the power to override any changes that may have been made by the House of Lords or even to insist that a bill rejected by the House of Lords should, nevertheless, be passed and proceed to receive the royal assent. The justification for this is that the House of Commons is democratically elected and so represents the will of the people in a way that the members of the House of Lords, not being elected, cannot do.

If the government wants to survey opinion before proposing a bill, it can publish a 'green paper' which explains why a new law could be added and possible approaches. Once the government has decided on its approach to a piece of legislation it can then publish a 'white paper' which forms the basis for debate to create a bill.

> Acts of Parliament constitute what is known as primary legislation. The complexity of modern society makes it impossible for all laws to be examined in detail by parliament. To overcome this difficulty, an Act of Parliament will often make provision for secondary legislation to be introduced. This means that detailed regulations can be introduced without full discussion in parliament. Instead, the proposed regulations are placed in the library of the House of Commons so that members of either house can look at them. If no objections are raised within a fixed time period, the regulations become law.

The UK was also part of the EU until 2020 which had its own parliament. The European Commission could issue directives agreed by all member states that require member states to alter their legislation to form a common standard.
