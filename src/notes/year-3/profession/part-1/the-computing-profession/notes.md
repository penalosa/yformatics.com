## Introduction

The are many definitions of the word 'professional' and it depends on the context in which it is used. However, in this course, we are going to focus on the idea of a 'profession' being an occupation. In general, we can say that most professions require substantial education or training set by currently practising professionals. Members of a profession could also organise into a professional body that sets an expected code of conduct which is enforced to all practising it.

> There are many professional bodies in Britain and they cover a very wide range of professions, including the law, medicine, many different branches of science and engineering, accountancy, architecture, surveying and many others.

Some professions have a title which is restricted by an Act of Parliament so it can only be held by members of the relevant professional organisation who have passed the relevant standards. Examples of this include architecture and dentistry.

## Royal charters

In the UK, any organisation that believes its main objectives are in the public interest can enter into discussions with the Privy Council with a view to being awarded a royal charter. A royal charter is a formal document, written in rather quaint language and signed by the monarch, which establishes the organisation and lays down its purpose and rules of operation. As they grow into mature organisations, most professional bodies seek and obtain a royal charter.

## Professional conduct

One of the most important functions of a professional body is to set out the standards that all members of that profession should follow. This is often done via a code of conduct that portrays the behaviours that all members of the body are expected to follow in their professional life. It can also be called a code of ethics. Codes of conduct should not be confused with codes of practice, which are concerned with the way in which the professional activities should be carried out.

For example, the British Computer Society (BCS) lays out its code of conduct on their website, you can see it [here](https://www.bcs.org/codeofconduct). It is broken down into four sections covering The Public Interest, Professional Competence and Integrity, Duty to the Relevant Authority and Duty to the Profession.
