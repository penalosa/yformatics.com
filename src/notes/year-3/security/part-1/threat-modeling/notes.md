## An adversary

All systems are vulnerable to many different types of threats but it is worth initially thinking about who your possible adversaries might be. Ask questions about what they are allowed to do what you can't prevent them from doing. Not all adversaries are malicious, they may cause a problem by simply being curious.

You can also think about the problem another way: what do we want to prevent an adversary from doing or learning. Consider what their aims might be. With this information, we can start to think about the set of threats we want to protect against.

There are many different types of adversaries to consider:

- Nature
- Script kiddies
- Crackers/hackers
- Organised crime
- Governments
- Terrorists

## Assets & vulnerabilities

Assets are things that we want to protect. They could include:

- Hardware
- Software
- Information

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that could be exploited.

## Threats

A threat involves loss or damage to a system, its users or operators.
