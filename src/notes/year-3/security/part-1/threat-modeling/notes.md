## Introduction

Computer security is the protection of assets on a computer system against adversarial environments. The aim is to only allow intended use and prevent unintended use.

## An adversary

All systems are vulnerable to many different types of threats but it is worth initially thinking about who your possible adversaries might be. Ask questions about what they are allowed to do and what you can't prevent them from doing. Not all adversaries are malicious, they may cause a problem by simply being curious.

You can also think about the problem another way: what do we want to prevent an adversary from doing or learning. Consider what their aims might be. With this information, we can start to think about the set of threats we want to protect against.

There are many different types of adversaries to consider:

- Nature
- Script kiddies
- Crackers/hackers
- Organised crime
- Governments
- Terrorists

## Assets & vulnerabilities

Assets are things that we want to protect. They could include:

- Hardware
- Software
- Information

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that could be exploited. Owners seek to minimise them within other constraints but some may remain, leaving some residual risk.

## Threats

A threat involves loss or damage to a system, its users or operators. The threat model varies based on who the attacker might be as different attackers will be after different assets.

A threat model consists of:

- Who is the adversary and what abilities and access they have.
- Where they are in relation to the objects we are trying to secure.
- What the aim of the adversary is, or what are we trying to prevent them from doing at the high level.
- What particular threats are we trying to prevent that, if successfully taken advantage of, will lead to the adversary achieving their goals.
- If there is more than one type of adversary and if they can collude.

## Security properties

When thinking about secure systems, there are three main ways to measure them:

- Confidentiality  
  Information is only accessible by authorized entities.

- Integrity  
  The data is untampered and uncorrupted.

- Availability  
  Both the data and the system that provides access to it are there when you need them.

Some other terms to be aware of include:

- Authenticity  
  The data is from who it claims to be from or sent to who it is intended for.

- Accountability  
  Actions are traceable to those responsible.

- Privacy  
  Messages are anonymous and the sender or receiver is not identified.

## Common defences

There are five methods that can be used to defend your assets:

- Prevent
- Deter
- Deflect
- Detect
- Recover

You can never prevent all attacks and some attacks connot be prevented. It is also important to examine the weakest links in any system because that is where attackers will target. There is no point investing in strong countermeasures if there is an easy way around them.
