## Introduction

Computer security is the protection of assets on a computer system against adversarial environments. The aim is to only allow intended use and prevent unintended use.

## An adversary

All systems are vulnerable to many different types of threats but it is worth initially thinking about who your possible adversaries might be. Ask questions about what they are allowed to do and what you can't prevent them from doing. Not all adversaries are malicious, they may cause a problem by simply being curious.

You can also think about the problem another way: what do we want to prevent an adversary from doing or learning. Consider what their aims might be. With this information, we can start to think about the set of threats we want to protect against.

There are many different types of adversaries to consider:

- Nature
- Script kiddies
- Crackers/hackers
- Organised crime
- Governments
- Terrorists

## Assets & vulnerabilities

Assets are things that we want to protect. They could include:

- Hardware
- Software
- Information

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that could be exploited. Owners seek to minimise them within other constraints but some may remain, leaving some residual risk.

## Threats

A threat involves loss or damage to a system, its users or operators. The threat model varies based on who the attacker might be as different attackers will be after different assets.

## Security properties

When thinking about secure systems, there are three main ways to measure them:

- Confidentiality  
  Information is only accessible by authorized entities.

- Integrity  
  The data is untampered and uncorrupted.

- Availability  
  Both the data and the system that provides access to it are there when you need them.
