## Introduction

Basically logic rules the world.

Although there is not one logic. There are many 'families'.

We will study two classical logics:

- propositional logic
- first-order logic

It may help to recall some of the logic notation from inf1 CL.

## Syntax & semantics

Syntax defines the sentences in the language. Semantics defines the meaning of the sentences.

Atomic statements are ones that cannot be further decomposed. Also called propositional variables. Atomic statements can either be true or false. The truth value of a formula is determined by the truth values of its atoms.

These can also be illustrated in truth tables.

## Satisfiabiolity & validity

A formula is satisfiable if there is some function that satisfies it. It is called unsatisfiable otherwise.

A formula is falsifiable if there is some function that does not satisfy it. It is called valif if every function satisfies it, making it a tautology.

Two formulas are logically equivalent if all fuctions that satisfy one satisfy the other and vise versa. Equivalent formulae have the same meaning even though they may differ syntactically.
