<!-- ## General logic -->

## Predicates & constants

In first order atomic logic, atomic statements use predicates with constants as arguments:

- Female(Mary)
- Male(John)
- Siblings (Mary, John)

Think of these essentially as functions that return true or false to work in logical expressions.

## Syntax of FOL

FOL = first order logic.

FOL uses variables and quanifiers. Predicates may have variables as arguments whose value may be bound by quantifiers.

> Every x is in $A$ or $B$

> $\forall x (A(x) \lor B(x))$

Sone of the symbols you can use are:

- Forall quantifier $\forall$
- There exists quantifier $\exists$

- Logical and $\land$
- Logical or $\lor$
- Logical not $\lnot$
- Logical condition $\to$
- Logical bicondition $\leftrightarrow$

The terms in FOL include:

- Variable symbols: $a, b, c...$
- Constant symbols: $x, y, z...$
- Predicate symbols: $P, Q, R...$

Free variables are those not in the scope of any quantifier. A variable that is not free is called bound.

## Semantics of FOL

A formula may be either true or false with a given interpretation.

This bit is something about the universe and giving meaning to $x$.

I am truly lost.
